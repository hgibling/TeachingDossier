# MMG1001 - Foundational Genetics Approaches I
MMG1001 is a required course for incoming graduate students in the Molecular Genetics MSc and PhD programs at the University of Toronto. The course is divided into three units: Genetics, Genomics, and Proteomics. I TAed for the Genomics unit for five weeks in Fall 2020, with primary duties consisting of leading a weekly tutorial that discussed an assignment and leading students through a related computational assignment. Other TA duties included developing the unit syllabus, attending 2 weekly lectures and answering student questions in the chatbox, and assisting with writing questions for the unit exam.

## Genomics Unit
* **Date**: Fall 2020
* **Education Level**: 1st year Graduate
* **Objective**: Discuss genomics papers in detail and expose students to related computational tasks that they might encounter during their graduate career.
* **Collaborators**: Kaitlin Laverty (University of Toronto) and Laura Campitelli (Univeristy of Toronto)
* **Materials**: 
  * [Tutorial 1: Pfam](https://github.com/hgibling/TeachingDossier/blob/main/MMG1001/Tutorial1/Tutorial1-Pfam.pdf)
  * [Tutorial 2: Haplotype Blocks](https://github.com/hgibling/TeachingDossier/blob/main/MMG1001/Tutorial2/Tutorial2-HaplotypeBlocks.pdf)

  * Additional files in corresponding folders
* **My Constributions**: 
  * Compiled complete slide decks for Tutorials 1 and 3
  * Modified original slide decks for Tutorials 2 and 4 for clarity and to highlight insightful questions
  * Primary developer of Assignment 1: Compare tools for protein domain identification and Assignment 3: Using RNAi screens to predict phenotypes of orthologous genes
    * Developed all questions after discussing general ideas with Kaitlin Laverty
  * Secondary developer of Assignment 2: Investigating linkage disequilibrium in different populations (originally by Kaitlin Laverty)
    * Developed the group worksheet, questions 1, 2, and 7, and the additional question
    * Researched additional loci for a possible haplotype block in BRCA2
    * Reworded original questions 3-6 for clarity
  * Edited Assignment 4: Working with BED Files in Galaxy and Conducting GO Enrichment Analysis (originally by Laura Campitelli)
    * Modified original assignment to simplify the pipeline to work completely in Galaxy and the Gene Ontology website
    * Added additional ChIP-Seq peaks file (limb)
    * Reformatted original assignment to better work for teaching in an online environment by adding screenshots
    * Reworded original steps for clarity
