# Let's Talk Science
In collaboration with Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health

As a volunteer with the University of Guelph chapter of Let's Talk Science, I participated in two collaborative educational activities with our local public health unit. Student volunteers partnered with Health Promotion Specialists at Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health to develop one-hour activities on health-related topics for a variety of grades. The two activities I participated in were **Daily Physical Activity** and **Smoke-Free Outdoor Spaces**.
